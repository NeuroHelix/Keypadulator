# Keypadulator
An unfinished/in progress webapp that simulates a keypad to a security system. Frontend only, everything takes place in the browser. HTML, CSS, JS.
Loosely inspired by a 6150 by honeywell. Text will appear on the screen after each command to show you where you are in keypad programing.

The goal of this project is to make it easy for field techs to have a side-by-side to follow along with while programing alarm systems, however this is a work in progress!
