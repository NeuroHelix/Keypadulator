# Keypadulator
An unfinished/in progress web security keypad simulator for learning to program home security systems.
Loosely inspired by a 6150 by honeywell. Text will appear on the screen after each command to show you where you are in keypad programing.

The goal of this project is to make it easy for field techs to have a side-by-side to follow along with while programing alarm systems, however this is a work in progress!
